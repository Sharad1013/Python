# Lists are a set of values to store a set of values in a container of any data type.

friends = ["Apple","Orange",3.2, 1,5, True];

# print(friends[4])
friends[0] = "sharad"  # No errors as unlike Strings lists are mutable.
# print(friends) 

# Strings are immutable but unlike string lists are mutable. ( done above )


# Lists Slicing
print(friends[1:4])

# List Methods
# All the String methods used to return a new String so it was needed to print them but not with lists.
