# Set is a collection of non-repetitive elements.
s = {1,2,5,23,5,3,4,5,5,5,55} # sets and dictionary both are created using {} the only difference is that a set has only values and no keys while the dictionary has both.

# empty set
# e = set() --> That is how you make an empty set if you do e = set{} it will create an empty dictionary

# Set stores the unique values only but does not maintains the order.
print(s)
