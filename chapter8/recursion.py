                    RECURSION
    Recursion is a function which calls itself.
It is used to directly use a mathematical formula as function 

'''
def factorial(n):
    # Base Case
    if(n == 1 or n == 0):
        return 1
    
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

# print(factorial(5))
# print(factorial(7))

'''The programmer needs to be extremely careful while working with recursion to ensure that the function doesnâ€™t infinitely keep calling itself. Recursion is sometimes the most direct way to code an algorithm.'''
