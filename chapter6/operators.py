# RELATIONAL OPERATORS

# Relational Operators are used to evaluate conditions inside the if statements. Some examples of relational operators are:

# ==: equals.
# > =: greater than/ equal to.
# < =: lesser than/ equal to. LOGICAL OPERATORS
# In python logical operators operate on conditional statements. For Example:
# • and – true if both operands are true else false.
# • or – true if at least one operand is true or else false.
# • not – inverts true to false & false to true. ELIF CLAUSE

# elif in python means [else if]. An if statements can be chained together with a lot of these elif statements followed by an else statement.
